URLCat example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of java.net.URL object to open a stream to read the data from.

$ hadoop namenode -format
$ start-all.sh
$ echo "hello world" > hello.txt
$ hadoop fs -put hello.txt hello.txt
$ export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=build/URLCat.jar
hadoop URLCat hdfs://localhost/user/javi/hello.txt
hello world

One of the simplest ways to read a file from a Hadoop filesystem is by using a
java.net.URL object to open a stream to read the data from. 

setURLStreamHandlerFactory method can be called only once per JVM, so it is 
typically executed in a static block. This limitation means that if some
other part of your program—perhaps a third-party component outside your 
control—sets a URLStreamHandlerFactory, you won’t be able to use this approach 
for reading data from Hadoop.

The alternative is to use the FileSystem API to open an input stream for a file.

This example reading data using the Hadoop Filesystem API. 

% hadoop FileSystemCat hdfs://localhost/user/javi/hello.txt
hello world
